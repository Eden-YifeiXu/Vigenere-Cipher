# Vigenere-Cipher

Create a Vigenere cipher Python program utilizing the following steps: 

1. Ask the user to enter a string message (the text, or in the parlance of cryptography, the plaintext). Use the Python input function. 

2. Ask the user to enter a key. Again, use the Python input function. Please error check that the key is valid. A valid key will consist only letters. 

3. Encrypt the user's message with the Vigenere cipher and print the encrypted messaged to the screen. Only encrypt letters. Any non-letters should be kept unaltered. 

4. Decrypt the encrypted message back to a plaintext message and print the plaintext to the screen.
